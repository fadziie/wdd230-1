            The Durban City Hall, also known as the eThekwini City Hall, was built in the early 1900s in classic neo-Baroque-style. The design of the building is based on Belfast's City Hall in Northern Ireland. An impressive central dome rises to 48m, and is surrounded by 4 smaller domes. Each of the smaller domes has a statue which represents art, literature, music and commerce. This impressive building also houses Durban's Natural Science Museum, a public library, auditorium, and the Durban Art Gallery. Items to see include a dodo skeleton, Egyptian mummy, and plenty of other fossils.
